[Bellabeat Presentation: How can a wellness company play it smart?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dSCR1jLDKBqQAqrwvCR2fgKgZaIAKtZnE-l4_hw_GmM/present#slide=id.p)

This is my capstone project, a culmination of my journey through the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. My professional path has consistently gravitated towards fintech and technology-centered enterprises, driven by my passion for innovation.

The allure of Bellabeat's project beckoned to me due to its dual emphasis on women's wellness and technological advancement. This company's commitment to harnessing technology for growth resonates deeply with my aspirations, making it an ideal choice for my capstone endeavor.


## **Introduction**

I am a junior data analyst who works on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.

Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. The company has 5 focus products: Bellabeat App, Leaf, Time, Spring and Bellabeat Membership.

Our team has been asked to analyze non-Bellabeat smart device data to gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices. And select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights and help guide marketing strategy for the company.

This case study follows the six step data analysis process called APPASA

[6. Act](https://github.com/BuseGogusger/bellabeat_capstone_project#6-act)


## **1. Ask**

**Business Task**

Analyzing non-Bellabeat smart device fitness data to discover and identify trends which could lead new growth opportunities and gaining insights which will help and guide the marketing strategy for the company.

Guiding questions for this analysis:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat’s marketing strategy?

**Key Stakeholders**

Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer,

Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s co-founder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team,

Bellabeat Marketing Analytics Team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy

## **2. Prepare**

**Data Source**

Data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files. (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Kaggle member Möbius) The dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data which includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

**Limitations**

Data has some limitations. First of all; sample size is for only 30 FitBit users and this could not be used as representative of the smart device user population as a whole. So this data has sampling bias. Also data was collected 7 years ago and it only covers a 2 weeks time frame.

**What about ROCCC?**

- Reliable : No - This data set is not reliable because it comes from only 30 people, which can not be counted as a good representation of all FitBit users. When we check the sample for confidence level, the margin of error amount is too high and the sample size should be at least 10 times bigger than current data.
- Original : No - Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk) conducted and collected the survey.
- Comprehensive : No - .Data does not have some key characteristics of the participants such as gender, age, height, location etc. And also sampling size is too little and the time frame is not enough to truly discover the trends in the data set.
- Current : No - The data was collected 7 years ago, so it may not be relevant anymore.
- Cited : No - Cited but not credible. Amazon Mechanical Turk collected the data but they could be a reliable source or not. More search needs to be done.

In order to move forward first we need to prepare our dataset. 
We will use "install.packages()" and "library()" functions to install and load R packages.
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("here")
install.packages("hms")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("gridExtra")
install.packages("paletteer")
install.packages("crayon")
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("patchwork")
install.packages("ggthemes")
install.packages("ggforce")
install.packages("personograph")
install.packages("ggbeeswarm")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("ggpubr")
install.packages("ggrepel")
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("scales")

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggrepel)
library(reshape2)
library(scales)
library(here)
library(hms)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(skimr)
library(gridExtra)
library(paletteer)
library(crayon)
library(stringr)
library(patchwork)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggforce)
library(personograph)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(knitr)
```

In order to import our data we will use following code, and we will create data frames while importing. We chose these ones to summarize our data set better.

```
daily_activity <- read_csv("fitbit_data/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_calories <- read_csv("fitbit_data/dailyCalories_merged.csv")
daily_intensities <- read_csv("fitbit_data/dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
daily_steps <- read_csv("fitbit_data/dailySteps_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read_csv("fitbit_data/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight_log <- read_csv("fitbit_data/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
hourly_calories <- read_csv("fitbit_data/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
hourly_intensities <- read_csv("fitbit_data/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv("fitbit_data/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
minute_sleep <- read_csv("fitbit_data/minuteSleep_merged.csv")
heart_rate <- read_csv("fitbit_data/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
```



## **3. Process**

In order to understand more about our dataset and take a closer look, we will be using “head()”, “colnames()” and my favorite one “str()” functions.

**head()** displays the first couple rows present in the input data frame
```
head(daily_activity)
head(daily_calories)
head(daily_intensities)
head(daily_steps)
head(daily_sleep)
head(weight_log)
head(hourly_calories)
head(hourly_intensities)
head(hourly_steps)
head(minute_sleep)
head(heart_rate)
```
**colnames()** returns or sets the names of the columns in a data frame.
```
colnames(daily_activity)
colnames(daily_calories)
colnames(daily_intensities)
colnames(daily_steps)
colnames(daily_sleep)
colnames(weight_log)
colnames(hourly_calories)
colnames(hourly_intensities)
colnames(hourly_steps)
colnames(minute_sleep)
colnames(heart_rate)
```
**str()** compactly displays the internal structure of a R object. Which I love using while I am trying to get a broader sense of the data.
```
str(daily_activity)
str(daily_calories)
str(daily_intensities)
str(daily_steps)
str(daily_sleep)
str(weight_log)
str(hourly_calories)
str(hourly_intensities)
str(hourly_steps)
str(minute_sleep)
str(heart_rate)
```
While we were checking our data, we saw some inconsistencies across the data frames. We will be addressing them while cleaning our data. So that we won't be facing any problems down the line while analyzing our data.

  )
```


## **4. Analyze**

While we are moving forward with our task, we are now at the analysis phase. We will start with some summary statistics to summarize our data to better understan and analyze it.

### **Lets Count Our Data**

In our data frames how many unique id's we have?
```
n_distinct(daily_activity$id)
n_distinct(daily_steps$id)
n_distinct(daily_sleep$id)
n_distinct(minute_sleep$id)
n_distinct(sleep_quality$id)
n_distinct(sleep_summary$id)
n_distinct(sleep_data$id)
n_distinct(weight_log$id)
n_distinct(hourly_calories$id)
n_distinct(hourly_intensities$id)
n_distinct(hourly_steps$id)
n_distinct(heart_rate$id)
```
By this we can see that our data frames how related to one another
In our data frames, how many observations we have? We will have them by calculating rows.
```
nrow(daily_activity)
nrow(daily_sleep)
nrow(daily_steps)
nrow(minute_sleep)
nrow(sleep_quality)
nrow(sleep_summary)
nrow(sleep_data)
nrow(weight_log)
nrow(hourly_calories)
nrow(hourly_intensities)
nrow(hourly_steps)
nrow(heart_rate)
```


Our hourly observations has same number of observations while the daily observations, minute_sleep and heart_rate observations vary.

Also heart_rate, weight_log and minute_sleep dfs has very low number of outputs. So we have to keep in mind that we can't base our analysis solely on these data

### **Time for Summary Statistics**

Now we will pull some key statistics to overview our data for each dataframe. (Daily total steps, calories, distance, active minute levels etc.)
```
daily_activity %>%
  select(
    total_steps, total_distance, very_active_min, fairly_active_min, 
    lightly_active_min, sedentary_min, calories
  ) %>%
   summary()
```
![daily](https://github.com/BuseGogusger/bellabeat_capstone_project/assets/135744125/4ca9cd51-34b5-4b63-b3a3-70bace8b4442)


**Notes on Daily Statistics**

In our summary we can see that users' average daily steps is 7.638 and this number is below CDC's recommended daily healthy steps amount which is 10.000.

When we look at the categorical data about daily activities sedentary time of the users are concerning. Average 991.2 minutes per day for sedentary time which means 16.52 hours is critically high and can cause several health problems. The Fitbit users need to be warned about taking a break from sedentary time in every 30 minutes as recommended.

Their combined daily average of very active and fairly active minutes is 34.72, which falls between the recommended amount of moderate-intensity physical activity (150-300 minutes per week) by WHO.

On the other hand average user is burning 2.304 calories a day according to our summaries which is between the scales of general studies' average (1.600-2.400).
```

**Notes on Sleep Data Statistics**

Average sleep duration of the users is 419.5 which is nearly 7 hours. According to several articles conducted by AASM (American Academy of Sleep Medicine) a healthy adult needs between 7 and 7 and a half hours sleep duration in order to get proper amount of rest.

On average, users spend 458.6 minutes in bed, which means they spend an average of 39.1 minutes before falling asleep. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) advises that National Sleep Foundation says that spending more time awake in bed before falling asleep can diminish your desire for sleep and disrupt your circadian rhythm. This is because your body starts to associate the bed with being awake rather than being asleep. If you find yourself tossing and turning in bed, it is better to get out of bed and do something relaxing until you feel tired. This will help you to fall asleep more quickly and get a better night's sleep.
```

  select(
    value

**Notes on Heart Rate Data Statistics**

In the heart rate data frame we face the challenge about the low number of users. But despite the insufficient data from the heart rate data frame 77.83 beats per minute fits the average amount of "normal" range. But we have to remember that heart rate is highly divergent value and can't be normalized according to population. So it needs to have more data and needs to be monitored more broadly.
```
weight_log %>%
  select(
   weight_kg,
   bmi
  ) %>%

**Notes on Weight Data Statistics**

We face the same challenge about the weight log data as well. But in order to analyze what we have at hand gives us a glimpse. 25.19 BMI is considered as an overweight by CDC.

If we check about the average weight statistics of our users which is 72.04, shows us that this average falls below the statistical average of CDC researches.

**Notes on Hourly Data Statistics**

Statistical data shows that average hourly calories burned 97.39 for Fitbit users with 12 minutes intensity and 0.2 minutes average intensity per hour. General daily activities of Fitbit users around light or sedentary category and average hourly intensities are low. And according to researches while sleeping you burn 40-55 calories per hour and a bit more while watching TV or reading books.

### **Lets Explore Our Data Some More**

First lets start about our daily data frames and dig a little bit deeper. We mentioned about daily steps and active minutes amount before. Now we will take a look at the relationship between those and calories burned.
```
ggplot(daily_activity, aes(x = total_steps, y = calories)) +
  geom_point(color="lightsalmon1", position = "jitter" ,alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(color="aquamarine3") +
  labs(title = "Daily Steps Total vs Calories Burned") +
  ylab("Calories Burned") +
  xlab("Daily Steps Total")

cor.test(daily_activity$very_active_min, daily_activity$calories)

ggplot(daily_activity, aes(x = very_active_min, y = calories)) +
  geom_point(color="lightsalmon1", position = "jitter" ,alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(color="aquamarine3") + 
  labs(title = "Very Active Minutes vs Calories Burned") +
  ylab("Calories Burned") +
  xlab("Very Active Minutes")

cor.test(daily_activity$total_steps, daily_activity$calories)
```
![Daily Steps Total vs calories](https://github.com/BuseGogusger/bellabeat_capstone_project/assets/135744125/2b7cc365-34ce-45ea-b65e-dcfa4a492857)

![Very Active Mins vs Calories](https://github.com/BuseGogusger/bellabeat_capstone_project/assets/135744125/b0dd0bd0-7edb-4c73-8e25-41ed6c28b000)

In these two plots trend line with a shadow represents %95 confidence interval between the variables.And in both of these plots variables have positive correlation. This means the more steps you take, more calories are burned and same goes for very active people as well. If you are a very active person, you will be burning more calories. Since we mentioned correlations, we also calculated correlation coefficients above.

Lightly active minutes average was much more higher than very active minutes average in the previous analysis, so lets see the relationship between the calories burned and lightly active minutes.
```
ggplot(daily_activity, aes(x = lightly_active_min, y = calories)) +
  geom_point(color="lightsalmon1", position = "jitter" ,alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(color="aquamarine3") +
  labs(title = "Lightly Active Minutes vs Calories Burned") +
  ylab("Calories Burned") +
  xlab("Lightly Active Minutes")

cor.test(daily_activity$lightly_active_min, daily_activity$calories)
```
![Lightly Active Minutes vs Calories](https://github.com/BuseGogusger/bellabeat_capstone_project/assets/135744125/27f1773f-1df4-457e-9c78-8e441fa30244)

The relationship is still positive but it is much more weaker than the others as expected.

Lets take another look at the daily data and this time analyze the relationship between daily sleep and sleep quality. Does is differentiate between the weekdays and weekends? Is there any different trends?
```
labels_for_days <- c(
  "Monday" = "Monday", "Tuesday" = "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday" = "Wednesday", "Thursday" = "Thursday",
  "Friday" = "Friday", "Saturday" = "Saturday",
  "Sunday" = "Sunday"
)
limits_for_days <- c(
  "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday",
  "Saturday", "Sunday"
)

ggplot(sleep_data) +
  geom_point(
    aes(
      x = weekdays.POSIXt(activity_date), 
      y = total_asleep_merged,
      color = as.factor(time_of_week)
    ),
      alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  labs(title = "Weekly Total Asleep Minutes") +
  guides(color = "none") +
  ylab("Asleep Minutes") +
  scale_x_discrete(
    "Day of the Week",
    labels = labels_for_days, 
    limits = limits_for_days
  ) +
  stat_summary(
    aes(x = weekdays.POSIXt(activity_date), y = total_asleep_merged),
    fun = mean, 
    geom = "point", 
    color = "brown3", 
    size = 2,
    alpha = 1
)

```

```
ggplot(sleep_data) +
  geom_point(
    aes(
      x = weekdays.POSIXt(activity_date), 
      y = total_restless_merged,
      color = as.factor(time_of_week)
    ),
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  labs(title = "Weekly Total Restless Minutes") +
  guides(color = "none") +
  ylab("Restless Minutes") +
  scale_x_discrete(
    "Day of the Week",
    labels = labels_for_days, 
    limits = limits_for_days
  ) +
  stat_summary(
    aes(x = weekdays.POSIXt(activity_date), y = total_restless_merged),
    fun = mean, 
    geom = "point", 
    color = "brown3", 
    size = 2,
    alpha = 1
  )
```

On our graphs averages are shown in dark salmon dots. According to those dots average total asleep minutes are highest on Saturday, Sunday (as expected) and Wednesday. Also average restless minutes are on Saturday and Sunday as well. Even though people tend to sleep more on weekends, it seems that quality of sleep is not better according to the restless minutes.

User usage data is highly important for us so lets check daily usage of FitBit. We will use hourly intansities data frame for it.
```
usage <- hourly_intensities %>%
  group_by(activity_date_ymd) %>%
  summarize(hourly_usage= n()/33)

# Lets visualize it to better understand

ggplot(usage, aes(activity_date_ymd, hourly_usage))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="lightsalmon1")+
  labs(title ="Daily Usage of The Device", 
       x = "Dates",
       y = "Hours of the Day")+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = ("1 day"),
               labels= date_format ("%d-%b"),
               guide = guide_axis(angle = 60))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,24),
                     breaks = seq(0,max(usage$hourly_usage),by=2))
```
![Daily Usage of The Device](https://github.com/BuseGogusger/bellabeat_capstone_project/assets/135744125/92d68d11-11c3-4806-b5d1-1e3fd5c8f401)

When we check our graph we can see that after 17 days, users started to use the device lesser, and with 26th day usage starts to decrease dramatically.

Lastly, lets check the percenteages of active minutes to take a look at our data from broader view.
```
v_a_min <- sum(daily_activity$very_active_min)
f_a_min <- sum(daily_activity$fairly_active_min)
l_a_min <- sum(daily_activity$lightly_active_min)
s_min <- sum(daily_activity$sedentary_min)
total_min <- sum(v_a_min+f_a_min+l_a_min+s_min)

activity_min_perc <- c(v_a_min,l_a_min,f_a_min, s_min)
labels_min <- c("Very Active","Lightly Active","Fairly Active","Sedentary")
pct <- round(activity_min_perc/total_min*100)
labels_min <- paste(labels_min,pct)
labels_min <- paste(labels_min, "%")
pie(activity_min_perc,labels_min, srt=1 ,main="User Activity Percentages",col= c("coral4","coral3","coral","lightsalmon"))
```
